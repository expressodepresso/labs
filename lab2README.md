I was responsible for Amendments 6-10. 
Added a javascript file to go between pages using the arrow keys. Went through all the html files to add ids.
Attempted to add a hover function to show preview the amendment being hovered on the front page. Wanted
to show the first few lines of the "main" section of the hovered link in a popup. I failed and removed it.
